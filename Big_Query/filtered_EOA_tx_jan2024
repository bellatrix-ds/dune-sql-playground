This query shows a list of number of transactions, fist date transaction, last date transaction and last eth balance for each wallet, 
which we specify through another table already.


-- Step 0: Read list of our own wallet list
WITH target_wallets AS (
  SELECT wallet AS address
  FROM `peak-castle-455015-k4.wallet_address.target_wallets` 
),

-- Step 1: List of all smart contracts
contract_addresses AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT LOWER(to_address) AS address
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.crypto_ethereum.traces`
  WHERE call_type = 'create' AND to_address IS NOT NULL
),
-- Step 2: List of EOA which had transactions
active_wallets AS (
  SELECT
    LOWER(from_address) AS address,
    COUNT(*) AS tx_count,
    MIN(block_timestamp) AS first_tx,
    MAX(block_timestamp) AS last_tx
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.crypto_ethereum.transactions`
  WHERE block_timestamp >= TIMESTAMP("2024-01-01")
  GROUP BY from_address
)

-- Step 3: Exclude smart contracts
SELECT
  a.address,
  a.tx_count,
  a.first_tx,
  a.last_tx,
  b.eth_balance
FROM active_wallets a
JOIN target_wallets t
  ON a.address = t.address
LEFT JOIN contract_addresses c
  ON a.address = c.address
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.crypto_ethereum.balances` b
  ON a.address = b.address
WHERE c.address IS NULL  
ORDER BY tx_count DESC;
