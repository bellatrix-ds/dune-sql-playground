This query returns the top 10 wallet-to-wallet interactions (excluding contracts) for our uploaded addresses in Jan 2024.


-- Step 0: 
WITH target_wallets AS (
  SELECT LOWER(wallet) AS wallet
  FROM `peak-castle-455015-k4.wallet_address.target_wallets` 
),

-- Step 1: 
contracts AS (
  SELECT LOWER(address) AS contract_address
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.crypto_ethereum.contracts`
),

-- Step 2: 
txs AS (
  SELECT
    LOWER(from_address) AS sender,
    LOWER(to_address) AS receiver
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.crypto_ethereum.transactions`
  WHERE block_timestamp > '2024-01-01'
),

-- Step 3: 
eoa_interactions AS (
  SELECT
    sender AS wallet,
    receiver AS counterparty
  FROM txs
  WHERE sender NOT IN (SELECT contract_address FROM contracts)
    AND receiver NOT IN (SELECT contract_address FROM contracts)
    AND sender IN (SELECT wallet FROM target_wallets)
),

-- Step 4:
ranked_interactions AS (
  SELECT
    wallet,
    counterparty,
    COUNT(*) AS tx_count,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY wallet ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rnk
  FROM eoa_interactions
  GROUP BY wallet, counterparty
)

-- Step 5: 
SELECT *
FROM ranked_interactions
WHERE rnk <= 10
ORDER BY wallet, tx_count DESC
